# Letter Boilerplate

A boilerplate to quickly and painlessly generate high-quality letters through LaTeX.

Why settle for MS Word when you can get the job done using your text editor?

## Dependencies

1. LaTeX with the following extra packages: `fontspec` `geometry` `ragged2e` `enumitem` `xunicode` `xltxtra` `hyperref` `polyglossia`
2. [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/)

To install LaTeX on Mac OS X, I recommend getting the smaller version BasicTeX from [here](https://tug.org/mactex/morepackages.html) and installing the additional packages with `tlmgr` afterwards. Same goes for Linux: install `texlive-base` with your package manager and add the needed additional packages later.

To install pandoc on Mac OS X, run `brew install pandoc`. To install it on Linux, refer to the [official docs](http://pandoc.org/installing.html).

## Getting started

1. Run this in your terminal to clone the repo, move into the right directory and delete all the git stuff:

        git clone git@github.com:mrzool/letter-boilerplate.git && cd letter-boilerplate && rm -rf .git

2. Edit `details.yml` with your details, your recipient's details, and the desired settings.
3. Open `letter.md` and write your letter in markdown.
3. Run `make` to compile the PDF.

The template automatically includes `signature.pdf` after the letter's body as a final touch. Follow [this method](http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/32940/82423) to import your own signature.

**Note**: this template needs to be compiled with XeTeX.

## Available settings

- **`subject`**: The letter's subject (optional)
- **`mainfont`**: Hoefler Text is the default, but every font installed on your system should work out of the box (thanks, XeTeX!)
- **`altfont`**: Used to render the recipient address so that it stands out from the rest of the letter.
- **`fontsize`**: Possible values here are 10pt, 11pt and 12pt.
- **`lang`**: Sets the main language through the `polyglossia` package. This is important for proper hyphenation and date format.
- **`geometry`**: A string that sets the margins through `geometry`. Read [this](https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/Page_size_and_margins) to learn how this package works.
- **`letterhead`**: include custom letterhead in the PDF (see below).

## Custom letterhead

If you have already designed your own letterhead and want to use it with this template, including it should be easy enough. Set the `letterhead` option to `true` to activate the `wallpaper` package in the template. `wallpaper` will look for a file named `letterhead.pdf` in the project root folder and print it on the PDF before compiling the document. Change the fonts to match the ones in your letterhead, adjust the margins with `geometry` and you should be all set.
